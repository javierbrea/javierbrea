Hi, I'm Javier. I'm currently working as head of front-end software development at Telefonica Tech.

I'm writing code professionally since 2002, working as a front-end specialist since 2009, and as a front-end architect since 2014.

My main skills are: building web apps in JavaScript & Node.js, CI/CD, development tools, and E2E testing. Framework agnostic, currently using mainly React, Node.js, TypeScript, Github actions and Cypress. I am known for being methodical and detail oriented, a high quality code advocate, oriented to modular solutions, and open source author.
