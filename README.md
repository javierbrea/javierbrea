Hi, I'm Javier. I'm currently working as head of front-end software development at Telefonica Tech.

I'm writting code professionally since 2003, working as a front-end specialist since 2010, and as a front-end architect since 2015.

My main skills are: building web apps in JavaScript & Node.js, CI/CD, development tools, E2E testing and data modeling. I am known for being methodical and detail oriented, a high quality code advocate, oriented to modular solutions, and opensource author.
