Hi, I'm Javier. I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source. I'm writing code professionally since 2004, working as a front-end specialist since 2010, and as a front-end architect since 2015.

Some technologies I currently enjoy working with include ReactJS, Node.js, Gatsby, Cypress, ESLint plugins, CI-CD tools, etc. And I love to continue learning and exploring new techs.

I'm currently working as head of software development at [Telefonica Tech](https://tech.telefonica.com/).
