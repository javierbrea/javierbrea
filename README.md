Hi, I'm Javier. I'm currently working as head of front-end software development at [Telefonica Tech](https://tech.telefonica.com/). I'm writing code professionally since 2003, working as a front-end specialist since 2010, and as a front-end architect since 2015.

My main skills are: building web apps in JavaScript & Node.js, CI/CD, E2E testing and data modeling. I am known for being a high quality code advocate, modular solutions oriented, detail oriented and opensource author.
