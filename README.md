Hi, I'm Javier.

* My main skills are: Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, React.js. CI/CD and automation, development tools, E2E testing.
* I am known for being methodical and detail oriented, a high quality code advocate, oriented to modular solutions, and open source author. Good practices, clean code and documentation are my priorities.
